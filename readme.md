The code is written using Matlab's Live Editor.
It's pretty much self-explanatory, but the following paper should help understand the mathematical background:

Aerospace 2020, 7(9), 122; https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace7090122

Note that the code is still experimental, and might have some bugs.
Any inquiry and feedback should go to ttanaka@uh.edu.

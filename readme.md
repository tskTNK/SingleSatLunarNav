The code is written using Matlab's Live Editor. It's pretty much self-explanatory, but the following papers should help understand the mathematical background:

Aerospace 2020, 7(9), 122; https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace7090122

Aerospace 2021, 8(7), 191; https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace8070191

Note that the code is still experimental, and might have some bugs. Any inquiry and feedback should go to ttanaka@uh.edu.

Thanks!
